# PowerBI_Bike_Shop
Analysis of Bike Shop Data
In this project, I developed an interactive dashboard using Power BI to analyze data from a sample bike shop. The primary goal was to identify and highlight KPI's that can influence decision-making and strategic planning.

Delivering various business insights by identifying key trends, patterns, and metrics that can impact the shop's performance
Strategic Recommendations: Use the visualized data to support strategic discussions and recommendations for the business.
